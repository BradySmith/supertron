supertron! supertron! SUUUUPPPPPERRRTRRRRROOOONNN!

To run, navigate to the project root and run:

```
node app.js
```

Note: you will have to change the server URL in `index.html` to match whatever server url you want your clients redirecting to. (Will probably be your IP if you are playing locally).

Clients connect using the server address on port 8800 (default is http://localhost:8800)
